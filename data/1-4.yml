    - "Collaborative Practices Inventory (CPI)":downloads/1-4_Collaborative_Practices_Inventory.pdf := Agency Collaboration principles and practices can also be measured using the Visionary Focus (VF) (items 1-8) and People and Relationships (PR) (items 9-16) subscales of the Collaborative Practices Inventory  (CPI) developed by Elder (1994) of the Carlson Learning Company. The modified CPI is presented below using a 4-point Likert-scale format (“Rarely” to “All or Almost all of the Time”). The VF (designed to assess the shared vision of collaboration of the program from the point view of its staff members and the overriding goals derived from this vision) and PR (designed to assess the degree to which the program from the point of view its staff members are aware of the unique differences of others in attempting to make collaboration work) subscales contain 8 items each. := The CPI was designed to help individuals or groups who are involved or about to be involved in collaborative efforts understand their practices and behaviors when working with others. The practices and behaviors listed in the CPI have been identified through research as those contributing to the success of collaborative leaders. Both the VF and PR subscales underwent rigorous psychometric testing as documented in previous work by the consultant with an overall scale alpha of .88 and subscales VF .91 and PR .85, respectively.
    - "Developing a Partnership Agreement - The Partnership Agreement Development Tool (PAD)":downloads/1-4_Developing_a_Partnership_Agreement-The_Partnership_Agreement_Development_Tool.pdf := This worksheet can be used by organizations to assist in developing a comprehensive partnership agreement that clearly addresses each partner’s roles and responsibilities and many of the elements needed for the partnership to run smoothly. While agreements can and should be reviewed and revised over time, a strong agreement forged early in the partnership lays the foundation for a strong and sustainable collaboration.  Outlined below is a list that partners might include in a written agreement, although not every item needs to be addressed. Agreements vary, reflecting the uniqueness of the partnership.
