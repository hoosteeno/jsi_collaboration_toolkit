    h4. Case Study: Building Strategic Partnerships

    <div class="preface">
    h5. Preface

    The following case study centers on a community based program that seeks to provide training and education to teenage mothers, with the goals of helping them obtain a high school diploma and preventing or delaying a second pregnancy. The case study details the use of the tools in this chapter in forming a strategic partnership to pool resources, developing political clout to push their agenda, and creating long-term community-level change that would lead to a decrease in teenage pregnancy.

    Mary is the current director of the community based program Delivering Education, Leadership and Training Assistance (DELTA) 4 Girls, in Mississippi.  The program, in existence for 9 years, seeks to provide training and education to teenage mothers, with the goals of helping them obtain a high school diploma and prevent or delay a second pregnancy.  With a staff of seven and approximately ten volunteers, the program has been successful, with over 70% of girls graduating high school and preventing over 80% of girls from experiencing a repeat pregnancy during their high school years.  This program appeared to be making a positive impact on the community.

    The program itself was influenced by Mary’s own childhood experiences, when she witnessed two of her sisters experience teenage parenthood and struggle to finish high school. Mary saw that two of the largest barriers to finishing high school for her sisters were childcare during school and lack of free time to study.  The DELTA 4 Girls program offers free and reduced childcare for its program participants and an after school study room for them to use to complete their homework.  Further, the program develops and hones the participants’ business skills, offers résumé building assistance and tutoring, as well as other skills.

    Unfortunately, consistent with many other community-based programs, the presence of a nationwide recession was threatening the program’s funding.  With 35% of the program’s funds coming from government grants (federal and state funds) and 65% from private foundations and groups, it was likely that some of the funding would be eliminated.

    To prepare for this possibility and build the best case for continued support, a member of Mary’s staff suggested that DELTA 4 Girls consider partnering with other community based organizations and services to a) pool resources, b) develop and use political clout to push their agenda, and c) create long-term community-level change that would lead to a decrease in teenage pregnancy.  During a special staff meeting devoted to brainstorming the possible partnerships, Mary used the "Organizational Readiness Assessment":downloads/1-4_Organizational_Readiness_Assessment.pdf and the "Barriers and Challenges to Partnerships":downloads/1-4_Barriers_and_Challenges_to_Partnerships.pdf worksheets to determine if a partnership was wise and if her organization was ready to engage.  After group discussion about the pros and cons of such an endeavor, the organization decided to move forward with a plan to develop a new partnership.

    The DELTA 4 Girls team brainstormed about their collective strengths, weaknesses and organizational values to identify which organizations would be best to partner with.  Based on these findings, the biggest weakness identified for their program was its narrow focus on pregnant teens.  It neglected addressing needs of other related at-risk groups such as the partners of teenage mothers, the parents of teenage mothers, or children living in abusive environments, thereby limiting the organization’s understanding of the overall challenges in teenage pregnancy prevention.  By the same token, the program’s main strength was their ability to identify and obtain resources to run their program, as their funding had increased 300% over the previous seven years.  Therefore, DELTA 4 Girls decided to identify programs, persons, and organizations that addressed other at-risk groups and who could also benefit from their expertise.

    After this decision was made, Mary and her staff used the "Evaluating Potential Partners Worksheet":downloads/1-4_Evaluating_Potential_Partners.pdf to identify potential organizations to partner with.  Based on their current program and identified strengths and weaknesses, DELTA 4 Girls identified high schools (specifically school counselors in the schools), the county health department, the social services administration, local business organizations, area religious organizations, the local Boys and Girls Club, and area prevention specialists as possible partners.  Once complete, the team used the "Evaluating Potential Partners worksheet":downloads/1-4_Evaluating_Potential_Partners.pdf to conduct a preliminary analysis of how well each group would mesh with their organization.

    As part of this research, they examined the organizations’ official mission/values statements, their past activities, and their personal experiences with the organization itself.  Further, they surveyed their program’s current and former clients about their experiences with each entity.  Once the research was completed, two local religious organizations, a local school counselor, the social security administration and health department, the local Boys and Girls Club chapter, the Delta Business Administration and the local sexuality education coordinator, were chosen to be approached.

    Mary began to set up meetings with identified leaders at each organization.  This was done to 1) introduce the idea of collaboration to the organizations, 2) discuss what DELTA 4 Girls had to offer to a potential joint effort, 3) discuss the proposed goals of a collaboration and 4) determine if the other groups were able and willing to partner.  All but one group agreed that teenage pregnancy prevention was a goal they shared and were willing to work collaboratively to affect teenage pregnancy in their community.

    After the partner list was settled, Mary began the task of assessing where in the partnership continuum each group was, what the partnership’s overall goal should be and, ultimately, Mary began developing a working agreement amongst the partners.  A half-day introductory meeting was planned for the new partners to meet one another.  Prior to the meeting, Mary asked each partner to brainstorm 1) the strengths and weaknesses of their organization, 2) the skills or resources they were willing to contribute, and 3) the goals or outcomes they would like to see achieved from the partnership.  The results of each individual analysis were to be brought to the first team meeting.

    At the start of the meeting, Mary asked each partner to introduce themselves and explain their program or organization to the group and discuss why the issue of teenage pregnancy prevention was important to them.  After completion, the group discussed the results of the pre-meeting brainstorm exercise.  Finally, Mary asked each partner to complete the "Collaborative Practices Inventory":downloads/1-4_Collaborative_Practices_Inventory.pdf to determine where each group would fall in the partnership continuum and how to proceed with the work.  Overall, the majority of individuals indicated they were at the cooperation stage, as many were comfortable working with other organizations and agencies to accomplish their goals, but were still protective of their own resources to ensure the viability of their programs.

    The results of this exercise were used to inform the next phase of the project: Partnership Agreement.  However, based on the majority of the partners being on in the cooperation stage, everyone agreed that they needed more time to get to know each other, better understand their respective programs and goals, and negotiate what could be accomplished.  The items in the "How to Negotiate a Partner Agreement":#chapter-1/section-1-3/subsection-1-3-2/ section were distributed for each individual organization to review in order to determine their position, interests, and the bottom line for each.

    Armed with this task, Mary returned to DELTA 4 Girls and discussed each element with the staff.  It was agreed that their primary interests were to prevent pregnancy (both first and repeat) among teenage girls and increase the graduation rate among teenage moms.  However, their bottom line was that a commitment to developing and implementing effective educational strategies for teen moms must be included in the final mission of the partnership.

    Over the next three months, the members of the newly developed partnership met several times. Each meeting was spent discussing what the primary goal of the partnership should be and how they would meet this goal.  As the partners became more comfortable with one another, the group began to find new ways of compromising and combining resources to make their partnership a reality.  In the course of negotiations, secondary pregnancy prevention became a back burner issue, with primary prevention becoming the focus of the partnership.  However, the final mission did include the goal of providing mentoring and educational services to girls to help them graduate high school or obtain their GED.  Further, the school counselor agreed to develop a program where high school students could get course credit by tutoring teenage mothers.

    Finally, after three months of talks and negotiation, the partnership was comfortable with developing a partnership agreement.  Mary, having already identified the "Developing a Partnership Agreement":downloads/1-4_Developing_a_Partnership_Agreement-The_Partnership_Agreement_Development_Tool.pdf tool, distributed it to the group.  Over a day-long retreat at a local hotel, the group addressed each component of the tool to ensure each item was met, culminating in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to guide their current and future collaborations.
