      When the right organizational partners are identified and established, start building the relationship slowly.  A good idea would be to start working on small projects together instead of jumping into the big ones.  These can be scaled over time once each organization understands its role. As noted in the partnership continuum described previously, collaborative relationships are the building blocks for the vast majority of partnerships.  Organizations should strive to establish these collaborative relationships before they are needed and maintain these relationships, even if they are not immediately actionable.  

      One way to grow a relationship between partners is to involve them, where appropriate, in the culture of your organization.  Help them understand what you have learned about the issues surrounding adolescent pregnancy and parenting and why your organization does the things it does.  This may include client meetings or internal strategy meetings.  Turn the tables and attend some of their meetings, as well.  By understanding how each organization operates, you will foster a mutual understanding of the challenges each face.
