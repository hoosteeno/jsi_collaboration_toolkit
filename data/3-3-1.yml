    Knowing who your audience is makes it possible to plan your communication logically.  First, choose which key audience your message will focus on. You will need different messages for different groups and different channels and methods to reach each of those groups.  Next, consider whether you should direct your communication to those whose behavior, knowledge, or condition you hope to affect, or whether your communication needs to be indirect.  Sometimes, for instance, in order to influence a population, you have to aim your message at those to whom your audience listens to – clergy, community leaders, and politicians, etc.
    
    Step 1: Review the list below and rank each “audience” in terms of their importance to your work (not applicable, somewhat important, and critically important).
    Step 2: Decide whether you have been effective or not effective at reaching out to them.
    Step 3: Rank the 5 most critical audiences.  Check the appropriate boxes.
