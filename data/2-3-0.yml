      h4. Community Outreach

      An outreach strategy is a way in which your key messages are delivered.  Every conversation about your organization is an opportunity to deliver these messages; if your outreach efforts can successfully incorporate your mission and goals into your communications, more people hear your messages over time and come to recognize your organization.

      The term “strategic communications” encompasses the means – the plans, goals, practices, and tools – by which an organization delivers consistent messages about its mission and values to its key target audiences and partners.  Community outreach is strategic when it is integrated, orchestrated, and ongoing. The various pieces of your outreach strategy should “fit” together, complement and reinforce each other; and not contradict or unnecessarily repeat each other.

      Organizations sometimes struggle to clearly articulate values and mission in a way that enables distinct target audiences to relate to your mission, connect to your values, trust in your services, and take action to support your organization.  It is important to remember that community outreach is not about sound bites, glitzy brochures, fancy annual reports, and animated websites. Your organization’s outreach strategy should focus on advancing your mission, advancing support for your work, and increasing awareness in the community.

      Strategic communications are critical to your outreach strategy because, if done right, they can help you strengthen your partnerships and increase awareness by:  persuading, moving, and convincing your target audiences to help your organization achieve its mission.
