    The term partnership and related terms such as collaboration, coalition, network, task group, work group, cooperation and others, are used to describe a wide variety of relationships and structures.  For purposes of this Toolkit, partnership refers to a group of organizations with a common interest who agree to work together toward a common goal. That goal could be as narrow as obtaining funding for a specific intervention, or as broad as trying to improve the overall quality of life for pregnant and parenting adolescents in the community.  Likewise, the organizations involved might be drawn from a narrow area of interest, or might include representation from every segment of the community.
    
    A partnership is strategic when it provides your organization with the means and methods for advancing your mission. Strategic partnerships can later develop into stakeholder groups that can leverage greater influence in reaching elected officials and policymakers. Civic leaders, policymakers and other key influencers tend to have priorities that organizations can leverage to underscore the urgency of improving programs and services to adolescents including: 

    * Improving access to education to foster economic development and work skills; 
    * Enhancing public safety by preventing crime and reducing risk behaviors; and 
    * Encouraging civic engagement and service to a new generation.
