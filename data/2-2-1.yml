    In order to enhance your outreach efforts, you should understand how community needs and trends affect your services. This information will contribute to the overall success of your outreach strategy. A community assessment process can also provide the baseline rationale for creating new programs and eliminating duplication of services and programs.  Some of the following information can help your organization obtain more accurate insights into your community:

    * Demographic data (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic and educational attainment data, family structure, and language use)
    * Homelessness statistics
    * Substance abuse trends
    * Teen pregnancy statistics
    * Other service providers’ attitudes and policies about pregnant and parenting teens
    * Geographic boundaries of the community
    * Length of time the community has been in existence
    * General history of the community
    * Key people and leaders in the community
    * Issues of most concern to the community
    * Morale and involvement levels
    * Key allies and rivals

    A community assessment will help your organization’s overall outreach efforts by mapping trends, getting to know key players in your neighborhood and community, and collecting information about other services that are available in the community.  The assessment process can be a good opportunity to showcase your organization and its programs and services as well as build trust within the community.  A community assessment will also be essential in understanding community strengths.  For example, despite high adolescent pregnancy rates, the community may have low premature birth rates.  A community assessment will aid in identifying and delineating these strengths in order to build on your organization’s understanding of the community.

    The formal approach to a community assessment entails review of data and statistics as well as potentially running your own survey of the community. While this can be costly, city and county health boards, school boards, and public health agencies often have some of this information publicly available.
