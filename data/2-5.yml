    - "Worksheet 2&#58; Priority Communities for My Outreach":downloads/2-5-4_Worksheet-Priority_Communities_for_My_Outreach.pdf := Knowing your community makes it possible to tailor your communication appropriately.  First, choose which key communities your message will focus on. You will need different messages for different groups and different channels and methods to reach each of those groups.  Next, consider whether you should direct your communication to those whose behavior, knowledge, or condition you hope to affect, or whether your communication needs to be indirect.  Sometimes, for instance, in order to influence a population, you have to aim your message at those to whom they listen – clergy, community leaders, politicians, etc.  Sometimes policy makers are the appropriate target, rather than those who are directly affected.  These are only a few of the many possible ways to identify your audience.  Once you’ve done that, it will give your organization ideas about how to reach them. 
    - "Worksheet 3&#58; Develop SMART Communications Objectives":downloads/2-5-5_Worksheet-Develop_SMART_Communications_Objectives.pdf := Communications Objectives focus on the cycle of the communications process (to inform, engage, motivate to act and maintain relationships). Communications Objectives should have action verbs (e.g., educate, teach, inform, provide, conduct, enlist, mobilize, discuss, promote, build consensus).  Remember that Communication Objectives should be linked to well-defined desired or expected outcomes.  List your organization’s top objectives below, and then apply the SMART test to each objective: think critically about whether your objectives are Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound.
