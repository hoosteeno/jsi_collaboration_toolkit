    Knowing your community makes it possible to tailor your communication appropriately.  First, choose which key communities your message will focus on. You will need different messages for different groups and different channels and methods to reach each of those groups.  Next, consider whether you should direct your communication to those whose behavior, knowledge, or condition you hope to affect, or whether your communication needs to be indirect.  Sometimes, for instance, in order to influence a population, you have to aim your message at those to whom they listen- clergy, community leaders, politicians, etc.  Sometimes policy makers are the appropriate target, rather than those who are directly affected.  These are only a few of the many possible ways to identify your audience.  Once you’ve done that, it will give your organization ideas about how to reach them.
