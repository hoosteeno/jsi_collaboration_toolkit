    h4. Formal/Informal Assessments

    The *formal* approach to a community assessment entails review of data and statistics as well as potentially running your own survey of the community. While this can be costly, city and county health boards, school boards, and public health agencies often have some of this information publicly available. 

    Assessing this information can help you target your own survey to fill in any gaps.

    * "http://www.data.gov":http://www.data.gov - for useful health-related information
    * "http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/":http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/  - for 2010 Census Data
    * "http://www.census.gov/acs/www/":http://www.census.gov/acs/www/ - for the American Community Survey

    The *informal* approach to community assessments focuses on building relationships with other organizations in the community and pooling knowledge and insight. This includes connecting with those public agencies that have data publicly available as well as non-governmental organizations that have compiled their own statistics or could compare anecdotal information with you. Having a group of organizations pool information on their clients can result in a useful body of data that can guide coordinated program, funding, and outreach decisions.

    Whether you do a formal or informal assessment, the community assessment will require your organization to engage in and maintain an ongoing dialogue with community members. The findings of the assessment can help you better build and frame awareness of your program and services.  The "Preliminary Community Engagement Strategy":2-5-1_Preliminary_Community_Engagement_Strategy.pdf tool guides you through the questions and priorities that your organization should be aware of in developing your community outreach strategies.
