    h4. Focusing Your Evaluation

    As you decide on your outreach message and method for communicating, it is critical that you develop and implement an evaluation of the effort. All successful communication efforts incorporate methods of evaluation to help determine what worked or did not work, what to modify and what to keep or discard. Such evaluation efforts involve administrative indicators (such as, fiscal and personnel resources), implementation indicators (such as, reach-breath-scope, level of receptivity, and level of comprehension) and outcome indicators (such as, demonstration of utility or use, count of individuals or programs reached). Evaluation can assist with determining the efficacy of your communication effort and inform partnership engagement decisions.

    Keep in mind, if your intent is to determine whether your outreach efforts are being carried out as planned, then your focus is on Monitoring. If your intent is to determine whether your efforts result in a change of behavior or attitude, then your focus is on Evaluation. Both are critical to gauging the success of your outreach efforts. The following provides a review of steps you should consider in your monitoring and evaluation activities.

    The monitoring/evaluation assessment should be carried out in three stages – Pre-Assessment, Implementation and Post-Assessment.

    Pre-Assessment involves development, testing and refinement of your outreach goals, objectives and methods using a sample from your intended audience or audiences. Pre-assessment will allow you to address the following questions:
    * Who is your targeted audience?
    * What is the message you are you trying to communicate?
    * How is the intended message best communicated?
    * What factors will influence levels of comprehension and outreach success?
    * What strategies will enable you to address the challenges you’ve identified?
    * What resources do you have to work with, including funds, personnel (paid and volunteer), and in-kind contribution of facilities and equipment?
    * Given the level of resources available to you, which of the possible strategies can you implement well?

    The pre-assessment effort will allow you to utilize a communication approach that is well tested and better targeted for your intended audience or audiences.

    Next, Implementation involves the actual construction and conducting of your assessment through the testing and documentation of your communication efforts Goal(s), Objective(s), Program Measurement Plan, Task(s)/Outreach Elements, Indicator(s), Target(s), Measure(s), Outcome(s)/Expected Result(s). The best approach for implementing your evaluation is to lay out your activities in a Work Matrix (DOWNLOAD EXAMPLE HERE). The matrix serves as your operations plan and allows for documentation of the progress of our implementation efforts.

    Last, Post-Assessment involves a review of the evidence from the implementation phase. You should carry out a post assessment with the intent of using the findings to inform decisions for next steps and to determine the overall and objective-specific success of your outreach activities.  The post-assessment requires a focus on the results, effects or impact (expected or unexpected, intended or unintended) that can be reasonably attributed to the activities or actions of your efforts.

    Overall, this systematic approach to assessing your outreach efforts will provide you with a means of increasing the probability of their short and long-term success.
