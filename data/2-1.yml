      For those who work in the adolescent pregnancy prevention and parenting field, it is essential to have a robust understanding of the particular community you work with.  Taking the time to get to know your community assets and deficiencies is crucial, because engaging the community in your efforts to improve services will require that you are familiar with the people, the issues, and the history of the community.  

      This chapter will provide methodologies to help you increase your organization’s understanding of the community you serve and conversely design strategies to enhance the community’s general knowledge of your organization’s mission and goals.  Strategies for coordinating your outreach to community members, engaging your staff in outreach efforts, and setting objectives for your outreach efforts are also included.
