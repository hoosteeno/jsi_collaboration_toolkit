    This chapter provides information to bolster your organization’s understanding of the diverse types of partnerships.  It also provides guidance on how to identify potential partner organizations, negotiate and build strategic partnerships, and maintain these partnerships in a way that is mutually beneficial to both parties.  The tools and resources provided with this chapter will supply your organization with worksheets, assessment tools, and examples to facilitate your partnership building process.  

    The case study at the end of the chapter centers on a community based program that seeks to provide training and education to teenage mothers, with the goals of helping them obtain a high school diploma and preventing or delaying a second pregnancy.  While the program was making a positive impact on the community, the presence of a nationwide recession was threatening the program’s funding.  The case study details the use of the tools in this chapter in forming a strategic partnership to pool resources, develop and use political clout to push their agenda, and create long-term community-level change that would lead to a decrease in teenage pregnancy.  
    The term partnership and related terms such as collaboration, coalition, network, task group, work group, cooperation and others, are used to describe a wide variety of relationships and structures.

    For purposes of this Toolkit, partnership refers to a group of organizations with a common interest who agree to work together toward a common goal. That goal could be as narrow as obtaining funding for a specific intervention, or as broad as trying to improve the overall quality of life for pregnant and parenting adolescents in the community.  Likewise, the organizations involved might be drawn from a narrow area of interest, or might include representation from every segment of the community.
