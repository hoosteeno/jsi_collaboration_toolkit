    h5. Preface

    The following case study describes the efforts of a teenage pregnancy prevention and education outreach program that is working to change the dynamics of unhealthy relationships in a Hispanic community. The case study details the organization’s use of the tools in this chapter in setting goals, identifying a target audience, and crafting and tailoring messages to fit their target audience.

    Selena is the director of the Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices teenage pregnancy prevention and education outreach program in San Diego County, California.  Targeted at young adolescent and teenage Hispanic girls, the goal of Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices is to prevent unwanted teenage pregnancy, delay the onset of sexual activity, and if pregnancy occurs, to provide linkages to services to assist clients in caring for their child.  Finally, vouchers for free or reduced cost medical services, free condoms and birth control are made available to teens who want them.

    Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices has been in existence for eight years, with Selena as its founder and director. With the heavy migration of Hispanic individuals into the area, the demand for services has increased.  With this influx of new clients, Selena noticed that the girls who sought assistance were often three or more years younger than their sexual partners and that a traditional male-dominated culture assisted in fostering unhealthy relationships.  To make matters worse, these unhealthy relationships, which at times included physical, mental and/or emotional abuse, appeared to be reinforced by the girls’ friends, families and the greater community.  Conversations with young girls found that they were often afraid of losing or upsetting their boyfriend, causing them to consent to sex at younger ages or that their desire to have unconditional love and support made them want to have a child.  Concerned by this, Selena decided that she would work to change the dynamics of these unhealthy relationships in her community.

    h4. Case Study: Identifying the Purpose

    !(right)/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/images/case4.jpg!
    The first thing Selena did was meet with her staff and identify the exact campaign message needed.  A conversation was started around what the overall purpose and goal(s) were. Selena engaged the group in an exercise to clearly lay out Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices’ values and goals and what the organization tries to accomplish.  The following questions were posed to the staff:
    
    * What are the most important accomplishments of our organization? Can you describe in simple, short and clear terms what the organization does?
    * How do funders/stakeholders/clients react to our message?
    * How does our message help shape public perception of controversial issues?
    * What statements and sound bites will be most memorable and persuasive to our key audiences?
    * How does the message fit with our mission/vision and services?

    During discussion, the group realized that the current model for male-dominant relationships was being taught and reinforced by the following groups: faith organizations, media, peers and family.  The staff became aware that some of their potential funders were community leaders with traditional viewpoints, which could affect the overall success of the campaign and that open discussion about sexual relationships was still taboo in their community.  The issue appeared to be ingrained in the community, making Selena realize that several different audiences needed to be targeted.  Because of this, they decided a more positive approach to the issue would be beneficial, where they would focus on the benefits of a healthy relationship, including communication and respect between partners.  Therefore, staff decided that the official purpose of the message would be to promote the benefits of healthy relationships in their community.

    h4. Case Study: Choosing Your Audience

    !(right)/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/images/case9.jpg!
    Once the purpose was chosen, Selena began work to identify which audiences needed to be included in their campaign. Using the "Identify Your Target Audience worksheet":downloads/3-3-1_Identify_Your_Target_Audience.pdf, the Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices staff discussed the importance of targeting a range of audiences and how effective they had been in the past.  While the majority of the audiences were deemed as being “somewhat important”, because of the community’s cultural norms and values and by virtue of who the girls interacted with the most, the following audiences were ranked as the most important: health care providers, faith communities, recreational clubs, public institutions and media.
    
    Upon completing the worksheet, Selena set out to better understand each audience through use of the "Create a Profile for Your Target Audience":downloads/3-3-2_Create_a_Profile_for_Your_Target_Audience.pdf.  The tool proved to be very useful, as she realized that in order to be effective, each audience would require a different strategy and approach. For instance, health care providers would be interested in healthy relationships as it contributes to better physical, emotional and mental health outcomes both now and in later life while faith communities would be interested in delaying sexual debut, which has been found to be influenced by healthy relationships.

    h4. Case Study: Crafting the Message

    Now that the purpose was identified and the audiences profiled, Selena worked on crafting her messages.  In order to ensure that each message was appropriate, Selena focused on their content. First, Selena used the "Crafting Clear Communications Checklist":downloads/3-3-3_Communications_Checklist_and_Design_Principles.pdf each audience to ensure the message(s) addressed the principles described.  Keeping the Crafting Clear Communications Checklist on hand, she used the "Message Development worksheet":downloads/3-3-4_Message_Development.pdf to clarify the issue, why each audience needed to care about the issue, and what she wanted them to do about the issue.  Finally, she used the "Suggested Messaging tool":downloads/3-3-6_Suggested_Messaging.pdf to ensure that the language and content would be appropriate for the targeted group.

    While crafting the messages, Selena made sure that the mood of the messages appealed to the emotions she was attempting to elicit from each audience.  Because the overall goal was to promote healthy relationships and their benefits, she decided to stay away from an angry tone and rather use one of determination and hope.  For the faith community, the link was made between healthy relationships and decreased sexual activity and teenage pregnancy.  For recreational clubs, personal stories and messages from clients and teens were used to address the issue.  Finally, for public institutions, the cost differences/savings of promoting healthy relationships over ignoring negative ones was addressed.

    After the messages were reviewed and edits made, Selena and her group examined the language and chosen style of communication for each.  To determine the most effective promotion language and communication styles for each, Selena did research into what had worked previously and engaged in discussions with members of the target audience to gauge their preferences.  During this research phase, Selena set out to answer the following questions:

    <div class="pull-quote">
    * What is the primary language of the community? If English is not the primary language, how is communication translated?
    * How does the target audience receive its information (Internet, newspapers, radio)?  Where do they access such information (libraries, schools, etc.)?  How often is this information accessed?
    * How does the audience share information with each other?  
    * How does the community discuss adolescent pregnancy issues, if at all?
    * What are cultural norms that need to be considered?  Would a certain phrase be offensive?
    </div>

    Based on their findings, the decision was made to make the messages available in both English and Spanish, as much of the community was bilingual. Further, Selena found that groups preferred different modes of communication, all of which necessitated unique approaches. Finally, each group had varying cultural norms which led to different wordings of the same message.  For instance, discussion of contraception was removed from messages targeted at religious institutions so members would not be offended.

    Once the messages were developed, Selena set about ensuring that while different, each message was consistent with the overall purpose of promoting healthy relationships in the community.  Both Selena and her staff reviewed the messages to make sure they did not contradict one another.  A master list of each message and its target audience was developed for everyone to refer to in case questions were asked.  All materials were reviewed to ensure the appropriate message was on the appropriate item based on the audience set to receive it.  Finally, an informal focus group was held with a couple of members from each target audience to ensure the message was read and interpreted the way it was intended.

    h4. Case Study: Tailor Your Message According to Your Medium

    !(right)/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/images/case10.jpg!
    After crafting the messages, Selena set out to choose the appropriate medium for each.  Using the "Communication Channels tool":downloads/3-3-7_Communications_Channels.pdf, different approaches were chosen for each audience and for some audiences, multiple mediums were selected.  Once selected, Selena approached members of each audience to ensure their leaders would assist Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices in delivering the message.  

    Selena drew on resources leveraged from Healthy Lives’ business partnerships to develop brochures for physicians to pass out to patients, brochures and posters for the recreational clubs and public institutions, an internet website, presentations at faith institutions, press releases and community events to inform the greater population.   The tools "Checklist for Effective Brochures":downloads/3-3-8_Checklist_for_Effective_Brochures.pdf and "Characteristics of Quality Educational and Promotional Materials":downloads/3-3-9_Characteristics_of_Quality_Educational_and_Promotional_Materials.pdf were used to develop the brochures.

    Finally, members of each community were asked to review the tailored message to ensure that it appealed to the group for which it was intended.
