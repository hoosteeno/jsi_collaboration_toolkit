    - "Identifying Your Target Audience":downloads/3-3-1_Identify_Your_Target_Audience.pdf := Knowing who your audience is makes it possible to plan your communication logically.  First, choose which key audience your message will focus on. You will need different messages for different groups and different channels and methods to reach each of those groups.  Next, consider whether you should direct your communication to those whose behavior, knowledge, or condition you hope to affect, or whether your communication needs to be indirect.  Sometimes, for instance, in order to influence a population, you have to aim your message at those to whom your audience listens to – clergy, community leaders, and politicians, etc.  
    - "Target Audience Profile":downloads/3-3-2_Create_a_Profile_for_Your_Target_Audience.pdf := This tool will enable you to understand your audience so that your message can be tailored to their specific characteristics.
    - "Communications Checklist &amp; Design Principles":downloads/3-3-3_Communications_Checklist_and_Design_Principles.pdf := Your message will be very different if you are recruiting participants than if you are trying to rally the public, or if you are trying to convince a population at risk to change their habits.  Planning the content of your message is necessary to making it effective.
    - "Message Development":downloads/3-3-4_Message_Development.pdf := Knowing who your audience makes it possible to plan your communication logically. := First, choose which key audiences your message will focus on. You’ll need different messages for different groups and different channels and methods to reach each of those groups.  Next, create a message for each of your priority audiences.

Remember to make it relevant and worthwhile to the audience and provide an action step that they can take. 
    - "Learning Style Inventory":downloads/3-3-5_Learning_Style_Inventory.pdf := In crafting and targeting your message it is critical that you have rudimentary understanding of your audience’s learning style. Learning style refers to the way in which an audience member approaches and responds to a message and learning experience.
    - "Suggested Messaging":downloads/3-3-6_Suggested_Messaging.pdf := As a communicator in the adolescent pregnancy prevention and parenting field you likely face common, usually negative, stereotypes of pregnant and parenting adolescents. These stereotypes, which focus on the failures or deficits of the adolescents themselves, have a negative impact on your clients. It can also inadvertently impact your service delivery if your clients become 'problems' that must be addressed, rather than young and future parents whose potential and skills can lead to success for them and their children. When you develop your key messages, consider how your choice of words and your attitudes may reflect, even inadvertently, these stereotypes. Your organization is different because it embodies an opportunity for a new future for these adolescents and your community. := You know your community and your clients better than anyone. However, there are several key messages that are a good starting point. If these themes are incorporated into the messages you develop using this Toolkit, you are well on your way to communicating effectively. These elements may help frame a more positive set of messages to communicate to key audiences
    - "Communications Channels":downloads/3-3-7_Communications_Channels.pdf := Channels of communication relate to the medium through which you convey your key messages.  There are numerous channels to choose from in order to reach your target audience depending on what the members of your audience read, listen to, watch, and engage in.  It is critical that your organization understand what works effectively with different audiences. := This tool contains ideas for communications channels your organization can utilize for outreach.  The list is by no means exhaustive, but can provide ideas to help your organization start brainstorming. 
    - "Effective Brochures Checklist":downloads/3-3-8_Checklist_for_Effective_Brochures.pdf := It is critical that your organization understand what works effectively with different audiences.  Remember that each audience is unique, and that messages that engage some audiences do not necessarily engage all audiences. := Use this checklist to determine whether your brochures will be effective in engaging their audience.
    - "Quality Materials Checklist":downloads/3-3-9_Characteristics_of_Quality_Educational_and_Promotional_Materials.pdf := Your message will be very different if you are recruiting participants than if you are trying to rally the public, or if you are trying to convince a population at risk to change their habits.  Planning the content and layout of your promotional materials is necessary to making them effective. := Use this checklist to determine whether your brochures will be effective in engaging their audience.  

    - "Focusing Your Evaluation":downloads/3-3-10_Focusing_Your_Evaluation-Work_Matrix_Example.pdf := As you decide on your outreach message and method for communicating, it is critical that you develop and implement an evaluation of the effort. All successful communication efforts incorporate methods of evaluation to help determine what worked or did not work, what to modify and what to keep or discard. Such evaluation efforts involve administrative indicators (such as, fiscal and personnel resources), implementation indicators (such as, reach-breath-scope, level of receptivity, and level of comprehension) and outcome indicators (such as, demonstration of utility or use, count of individuals or programs reached). Evaluation can assist with determining the efficacy of your communication effort and inform partnership engagement decisions. := Keep in mind, if your intent is to determine whether your outreach efforts are being carried out as planned, then your focus is on Monitoring. If your intent is to determine whether your efforts result in a change of behavior or attitude, then your focus is on Evaluation. Both are critical to gauging the success of your outreach efforts. The following provides a review of steps you should consider in your monitoring and evaluation activities. := The monitoring/evaluation assessment should be carried out in three stages – Pre-Assessment, Implementation and Post-Assessment.
