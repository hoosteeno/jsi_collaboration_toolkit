    h4. Choosing Your Audience

    Once the purpose was chosen, Selena began work to identify which audiences needed to be included in their campaign. Using the Identify Your Target Audience worksheet in the Resources section of this chapter (LINK HERE), the Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices staff discussed the importance of targeting a range of audiences and how effective they had been in the past.  While the majority of the audiences were deemed as being “somewhat important”, because of the community’s cultural norms and values and by virtue of who the girls interacted with the most, the following audiences were ranked as the most important: health care providers, faith communities, recreational clubs, public institutions and media.
    
    Upon completing the worksheet, Selena set out to better understand each audience through use of the Create a Profile for Your Target Audience in the Resources section of this chapter (LINK HERE).  The tool proved to be very useful, as she realized that in order to be effective, each audience would require a different strategy and approach. For instance, health care providers would be interested in healthy relationships as it contributes to better physical, emotional and mental health outcomes both now and in later life while faith communities would be interested in delaying sexual debut, which has been found to be influenced by healthy relationships.
