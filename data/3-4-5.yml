    After crafting the messages, Selena set out to choose the appropriate medium for each.  Using the "Communication Channels tool":downloads/3-3-7_Communications_Channels.pdf, different approaches were chosen for each audience and for some audiences, multiple mediums were selected.  Once selected, Selena approached members of each audience to ensure their leaders would assist Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices in delivering the message.  

    Selena drew on resources leveraged from Healthy Livesâ€™ business partnerships to develop brochures for physicians to pass out to patients, brochures and posters for the recreational clubs and public institutions, an internet website, presentations at faith institutions, press releases and community events to inform the greater population.   The tools "Checklist for Effective Brochures":downloads/3-3-8_Checklist_for_Effective_Brochures.pdf and "Characteristics of Quality Educational and Promotional Materials":downloads/3-3-9_Characteristics_of_Quality_Educational_and_Promotional_Materials.pdf were used to develop the brochures.

    Finally, members of each community were asked to review the tailored message to ensure that it appealed to the group for which it was intended.
