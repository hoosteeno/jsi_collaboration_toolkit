    h4. Tailor Your Message According to Your Medium

    After crafting the messages, Selena set out to choose the appropriate medium for each.  Using the Communication Channels in the Resources section of this chapter (LINK HERE), different approaches were chosen for each audience and for some audiences, multiple mediums were selected.  Once selected, Selena approached members of each audience to ensure their leaders would assist Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices in delivering the message.  Selena drew on resources leveraged from Healthy Livesâ€™ business partnerships to develop brochures for physicians to pass out to patients, brochures and posters for the recreational clubs and public institutions, an internet website, presentations at faith institutions, press releases and community events to inform the greater population.   The tools Checklist for Effective Brochures and Characteristics of Quality Educational and Promotional Materials in the Resources section of this chapter (LINK HERE) were used to develop the brochures.  Finally, members of each community were asked to review the tailored message to ensure that it appealed to the group for which it was intended.
