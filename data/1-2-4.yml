    Partnerships can range from informal, minimal work between two organizations to very formal, contractual arrangements with the exchange of funds.  There is sometimes an evolution with specific partners that grows into an active relationship of exchange and support.

    The continuum of steps that results in a partnership often starts with coordination, progresses to cooperation and collaboration, and ultimately results in partnerships.  Each and every step is important and worth pursuing.  Your organization will likely work with organizations in each stage of the continuum outlined below, but you will not necessarily work through all steps in the continuum to form a partnership with every organization you develop a relationship with.

    Some of your efforts toward developing partnerships with other organizations will only progress through a couple of stages and result in cooperation among the organizations; whereas, others might result in a full partnership.

      # *Coordination*
      At this level, organizations learn about the services and clients served by the other organizations. They also learn about each organization’s motivation for participating in a partnership. There is a lot of organizational independence.  Self-interests and resources are defined.  Coordination may include an exchange of information and materials.
      # *Cooperation*
      Cooperation among organizations brings increased understanding of target audiences and motivations to participate in a partnership. There might be a minimal agreement, and the organizations may still be defining their roles and contribution. There is usually a greater appreciation of resources and skills that the partnership can bring.  Joint strategies start to emerge. 
      # *Collaboration*
      With collaboration, there is increased recognition of the values of each organization, trust, respect, a clear understanding of the benefits for each partner, and innovative ideas are presented to meet a common problem.  There can be challenges, but they are usually well worth the effort to benefit a group of clients or the community. At this stage, organizations are able to work together on a specific project to reach clients, provide education, or develop a marketing campaign.  Often organizations in collaborative relationships start to put plans in writing.  
      # *Partnership*
      In a partnership, there is a high level of trust and communication.  Roles and responsibilities of each organization are well-defined and developed.  There is a feeling of “us.” There might be shared space and staff, shared authority and decision making, and plans and agreements are in writing.  Overall, there is a vision.  Challenges continue especially in the area of funding streams and support. iii 

      It is important to note that the continuum process may sometimes be cyclical due to changes in the nature, type and extent of the partnership. For example, partnerships with school districts often require modification due to changing personnel at all levels and locations, as well as social and political factors influencing decision-making of administrators.
