    While a community assessment typically focuses on identifying gaps in services in the community, another key factor that will contribute to the development of successful outreach strategies for community engagement is gaining an understanding of your community’s existing resources or assets and leveraging them to support your outreach efforts.   The members of your organization can be more powerful community actors when they are not exclusively focused on needs, problems, and deficiencies. ^[i]^

    A community asset or resource is anything that is used to improve the quality of community life. ^[ii]^  Broadly defined, there are five different categories of community assets. These include:

    1.     Local residents: their skills, experiences, passions, capacities and willingness to contribute to the project.
    2.     Local voluntary associations, clubs, and networks: e.g., all of the athletic, cultural, social, faith-based, groups powered by volunteer members – which might contribute to the project.
    3.     Local institutions: e.g., public institutions such as schools, libraries, parks, police stations, along with local businesses and non-profits – which might contribute to the project.
    4.     Physical assets: e.g., the land, the buildings, the infrastructure, transportation, etc. which might contribute to the project.
    5.     Economic assets: e.g., what people produce and consume, businesses, informal economic exchanges, barter relationships ^[iii]^ – which might contribute to the project.

    These assets can be used by your organization to meet community needs and improve community life.  They are especially important when external resources (e.g., federal and state money) are not available or are not specifically targeted for the services you wish to implement or the population you wish to reach.  Identifying and mobilizing community assets enables community residents to better influence, gain control and become active shapers of change.  Improvement efforts are more effective and longer-lasting when they are from programs based on assessment efforts that focused on gaps between what a community has/d (assets) and what it needs/ed (deficits) to achieve the desired change. "Community Assets:  Potential Uses and Engagement Strategies":TKTKTK contains a list of potential ideas your organization can utilize to engage and mobilize your community’s assets in order to further your efforts.

    Understanding community assets plays a critical role in outreach because: 

    {list-style-type:none}* a) it allows your organization to better target gaps or factors that limit your capacity to be effective; 
    * b) it provides a means to cost-effectively enhance your efforts through the use of existing resources and 
    * c) by their very nature, community-assets are already being used to form and maintain efforts that increase the probability of your outreach strategies and tactics to be successfully implemented.
