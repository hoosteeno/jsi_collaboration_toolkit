    h4. Conclusion

    This Toolkit is designed to be utilized by organizations that serve adolescents in their continued efforts to promote, implement, and evaluate innovative programs in the field of adolescent pregnancy prevention and parenting.

    The objectives of this toolkit are to aid your organization in identifying opportunities for increasing strategic partnerships and community outreach, conducting an audience profile that identifies priority communities and target populations for outreach, and developing action-oriented messages tailored to specific audiences.  Indicators for success include:

    * Stronger partnerships with other organizations working in the adolescent pregnancy prevention and parenting field
    * Raised awareness in your community of the services offered by your organization
    * Expanded access to a wider range of resources for teen pregnancy prevention and for pregnant and parenting adolescents and their families
    * Enhanced support for teen pregnancy prevention, and pregnant and parenting adolescents

    Through the partnership-building process and implementation of outreach strategies that engage your community, your organization will be empowered to bring about more effective and efficient delivery of programs, to increase communication among groups and break down stereotypes, and create long-term, permanent social change.  Ultimately, the end goal of transforming communities to promote healthy adolescents can be achieved in large part through collaborative processes with local organizations and community members who share your interest and passion for change.
