    Partnerships may consist of loose associations in which member organizations work for a short time to achieve a specific goal.  In contrast, they can be long-term, and may even become organizations in themselves, with governing bodies, particular community responsibilities, funding, and permanence. Partnerships may draw from a community, a region, a state, or even the nation as a whole.  Regardless of their size and structure, they exist to create and/or support efforts to reach a particular set of goals.   Some common types of partnerships are:

    * _Community-based_: Look to organizations working alongside you on the front lines of your community. Local nonprofits may find that your values fit well with theirs, even if you are offering different types of services.  
    * _Government-based_:  Local governmental institutions may also be an excellent partner organization to explore.  In particular, schools and educational institutions may be excellent partners and provide access to the populations your organization serves. State-wide [Departments of Health and Education] partnerships are also important because of their data repositories.
    * _Faith-based_: If their mission aligns with yours, partner with local religious institutions. Places of worship are often regarded as important resources for a community, and have diverse congregations with various skills.
