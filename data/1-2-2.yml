    h4. Negotiating a Partnership Agreement

    <div class="gloss">
    Principled negotiation is founded on finding solutions for mutual gain.
    </div>

    Partnership negotiations should be oriented toward finding solutions or dealing with problems in a mutually beneficial way.

    To ensure that organizations get what they need from a partnership, partners must come to the negotiation table with a sincere interest in working together and drawing from one anotherâ€™s strengths. Your organization should clearly articulate what they can bring to the partnership, as well as understand what potential partners offer.  The Collaborative Practices Inventory on page 21 in the Tools and Resources is designed to help individuals or groups who are involved or about to be involved in collaborative efforts understand their practices and behaviors when working with others.
