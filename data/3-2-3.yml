      In addition, in crafting and targeting your message it is critical that you have rudimentary understanding of your audience’s learning style. Learning style refers to the way in which an audience member approaches and responds to a message and learning experience. Larson (2009), based on the work of Jacobs and Fuhrmann (1984), suggest there are four types of learners:

      <ul class="four-types">
      <li class='feelers'>
        <h4>Feelers</h4>
        <p>
          Feelers are very people-oriented, expressive and focus on feelings and emotions and gravitate toward learning experiences that explore people's attitudes and emotions so they are more likely to benefit from communications that give them the opportunity to interact, share opinions and experiences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class='observers'>
        <h4>Observers</h4>
        <p>
          Observers are more likely to watch and listen, be reserved and quiet and will take their time before responding to or acting upon what they hear – however, when they do respond or act they are generally right on target. They are more likely to benefit from communication experiences that allow them to consider various ideas and opinions, and they seem to thrive on messages that are more open and allow them to learn through discovery.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class='thinkers'>
        <h4>Thinkers</h4>
        <p>
          Thinkers are persons who rely on logic and reason as well as the opportunity to share ideas and concepts and prefer messages that challenge them to analyze and evaluate what is being communicated, so like Feelers they appreciate interactive communication, especially an approach that allows them to question the rationale behind what is presented. They are more likely to challenge messages they perceive to be too general or without substance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class='doers'>
        <h4>Doers</h4>
        <p>
          Doers have a learning style that is very common in this field since they are likely to be persons who want to actively be involved in the message development and delivery process, they want to take charge of the message and they are particularly interested in knowing how they are going to apply what is being communicated to their and other real world situations – so they like information that is presented clearly and concisely and will become impatient with messages that provide ‘additional’ or broad audience-focused information.
        </p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      Keep in mind that no one learning style is right or even better than another. To be effective, you must design and target communication strategy to accommodate style differences.

      Please note:  These five assumptions and understanding of how your audience learns are also true as you plan your outreach strategy. ^[i]^
