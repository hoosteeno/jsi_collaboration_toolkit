    There are a number of reasons why developing a partnership with other organizations might be beneficial.  In general terms, partnerships can concentrate the community's focus on a particular problem, create alliances among those who might not normally work together, and keep the community's approach to issues consistent. Some more specific reasons for forming a partnership might be:

      * *To bring about more effective and efficient delivery of programs and eliminate any unnecessary duplication of effort.* Gathering all the organizations involved in a particular issue can result in a more cohesive and comprehensive intervention. Rather than duplicating efforts, organizations can split up or coordinate responsibilities in ways that afford more participants access to programs and allow for a greater range of services. 
      * *To pool resources.* Many of organizations together may have the resources to accomplish a task that none of them could have accomplished independently. In general, organizations form partnerships to do just that - accomplish together what they cannot do alone. 
      * *To increase communication among groups and break down stereotypes.* Bringing together organizations from many sectors of the community can create alliances where there was little contact before. Working together toward common goals can help organizations break down barriers and misperceptions, and enable them to trust one another.
      * *To build networks and friendships.* Partnerships result in social benefits for staff, volunteers and clients in that people can form networks and friendships through involvement with the organization.

      * *To revitalize wilting energies of members of groups who are trying to do too much alone.* A partnership can help to bolster efforts around an issue. For organizations who have worked too long in a vacuum, the addition of other hands to the task can be a tremendous source of new energy and hope. 
      * *To plan and launch community-wide initiatives on a variety of issues.* In addition to addressing immediately pressing issues or promoting or providing services, partnerships can serve to unify efforts around long-term campaigns.
      * *To develop and use political clout to gain services or other benefits for the community.* A unified community partnership can advocate more effectively than a number of disparate organizations working alone. In addition, a wide-ranging partnership can bring to bear pressure from all sectors of the community, and wield a large amount of power. 
      * *To create long-term, permanent social change.* Real change usually takes place over a period of time through the process of individuals gaining trust, sharing ideas, and getting past their preconceptions in order to understand the real issues underlying community needs. A partnership, with its structure of cooperation among diverse groups and its problem-solving focus, can ease and accelerate the process of change in a community. 
      * *To obtain or provide services.* It may take a partnership - either initially or over the long term - to design, obtain funding for, and/or run a needed intervention in the community.
