    As employees of a community organization dependent upon philanthropy and public funding, increasing awareness of and support for your program is part of every staff member’s job, without exception. Strategic communications provides a framework that ensures every staff and board member is working from the same set of assumptions and understands how their work relates to your organization’s core values and goals.

    Your employees and Board members interact with current and potential clients, other organizations, funders, and the general public on a daily basis. Ensuring that they can communicate how important your work is to the community is vital to your success. They are already positioned to reach a number of your target audiences. Doing so will help you build public understanding, confidence, trust and can better prepare you to deal with routine challenges. In unexpected circumstances, it may even help your organization be better equipped to address and overcome a crisis.

    Strategic communications can be employed across your organization with all staff to:

    <div class="pull-quote">
    * Help set priorities and provide future direction. As strategic communications become integrated, the staff will be selective about developing projects that are within the scope of the strategic communications plan. Board members will begin to think more strategically about how they can integrate their other community ties into the organization’s work.
    * Improve performance and stimulate creative thinking. With everyone focused on the importance of certain audiences and what actions the organization wants from those audiences, it is easier to focus planning and creativity on common goals.
    * Build teamwork and expertise. When highlighting the synergy of communications activity, staff and board begin to collaborate and share information in new ways. They look for ways to set priorities, coordinate resource allocation, and improve internal communications.

    Your organization should strive for all staff and Board members to know the right message, use the right channels and ultimately be the right messengers. This will require you to equip your staff and Board members with the tools and skills to know the audience they are addressing, know the needs of the audience, know how to communicate with them and know the importance of their work as it relates to your organization’s mission.  In turn, your staff and Board will be more credible to the audience; they will feel that they know them and be more inclined to trust their message.
