    h4. Community Assets&#58; Potential Uses and Engagement Strategies

    <div class="gloss">
    Recommended data collection, analyses and interpretation&#58; Determine which strategies might fit best for you, and which would have the greatest impact in your specific community.     
    </div>

    The list below contains a few possibilities and ideas &#40;tactics&#41; for how to utilize your community assets in support of your efforts.
    
    * You can publish the assets identified and make them available to all community members. In doing so, you will stimulate public asset knowledge.
    * You can target a particular neighborhood or other area for development, on the basis of the asset patterns you have found.
    * You can use your knowledge of assets to tackle a new community project -- because now you may have more resources to work on that project than you originally thought.
    * You can find new ways to bring groups and organizations together, to learn about each other's assets -- and perhaps to work collaboratively on projects such as the one above.
    * You can publicize these assets, and attract new businesses and other opportunities to your community. In both this example and the one above, you are using existing assets to create new ones. &#40;This is what makes community work exciting!&#41;
    * You can create a school curriculum to teach local students about these assets, thus enriching their knowledge of the community and building community pride.
    * You can consider creating a 	&quot;community coordinator,&quot; &#40;or some other title&#41;, someone who would deal with assets every day. The coordinator's new job would be to find the right assets in the community to respond to any request or community concern. Assess whether this position would pay for itself.
    * You &#40;or the new coordinator&#41; can keep records on how assets are used in the community, and use those records to generate ideas for improving asset exchange.
    * You can set up structured programs for asset exchange, which can range from individual skill swaps to institutional cost-sharing.
    * You can establish a process by which community assets keep getting reviewed on a regular basis. New assets are always coming on the scene; it is good to keep up to date on them. By so doing, the whole asset-identification process can become a regular part of community life.[i]
