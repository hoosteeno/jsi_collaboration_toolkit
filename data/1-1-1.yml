      Strategic partnerships with other organizations can be vital to the success of your organization's goals and initiatives. Partnerships with other organizations have the potential to concentrate the community's focus on a particular problem, create alliances among organizations that might not normally work together, and keep the community's approach to issues consistent.  Most importantly, partners can advocate for your organization's goals while contributing their own contacts, skills, talents and assets, allowing your organization to broaden its impact while accessing new audiences. 

      Recognizing the importance of partnerships is not difficult, but understanding how to build those partnerships is critical.  Partnerships with other organizations take time and effort, but if managed well, they can help your organization achieve its goals more effectively and with fewer resources.  Remember, when forming partnerships your organization should strive for quality, not quantity.  Not all partnerships result in accrued benefits for your organization or your clients. Partnerships should be formed strategically, based on the value the partnership brings to your organization and your clients.  Working with organizations that do not have a mission or values that complement your own does not typically bring added value to your organization.
