      h4. Negotiating a Partnership Agreement

      Partnership negotiations should be oriented toward finding solutions or dealing with problems in a mutually beneficial way.

      To ensure that organizations get what they need from a partnership, partners must come to the negotiation table with a sincere interest in working together and drawing from one another’s strengths. Your organization should clearly articulate what they can bring to the partnership, as well as understand what potential partners offer.  The "Collaborative Practices Inventory":1-4_Collaborative_Practices_Inventory.pdf is designed to help individuals or groups who are involved or about to be involved in collaborative efforts understand their practices and behaviors when working with others.

      Negotiation is a skill that must be practiced. The following guidance can help advance partnership negotiations and produce desired results:

      (alternating)* *Honor the relationship.* The negotiation process involves partners you may work with over many years. If, in addition to the process of negotiating, your priorities include developing the relationship with your partners—for example, developing honest communication and trust—it can be easier to know when bending on a particular point may yield short-term gains but long-term costs. 
      * *Create a negotiation environment that encourages innovation.* Partners expand partnership options by engaging in brainstorming techniques and thinking "outside the box." If partners can respond to new ideas and be open to the unexpected, they will find unlimited opportunities to take a fresh look at their practices and beliefs about serving their clients.
      * *Be realistic and fair.* Partners are more likely to follow up on their commitments and less likely to circumvent the negotiation process if they feel the agreement is fair. Sometimes a neutral, external facilitator can help to ensure that the negotiations are realistic and fair to all. Partners should always consult with their programs’ legal and financial advisors before finalizing an agreement. 
      * *Recognize that each partnership is unique.* Each partnership needs to be structured to meet the needs of the organizations involved. Although you may know of an interesting and successful partnership in a nearby community, the partnership you are designing need not be the same. 
      * *Engage in active listening.* Focus on what others say, both on their actual words and the underlying meaning. This will help you understand the interests upon which agreement can be based. When your response makes it clear that you have really been listening, your partners, too, may be more prepared to listen. Active listening can produce better, more long-lasting relationships.

      (alternating reverse)* *Know your bottom line.* We all enter negotiations knowing what we ideally want. Thinking through alternatives to the ideal outcome, however, allows you to understand your points of flexibility. Be clear about fallback positions and their consequences before you start to negotiate. Also, evaluate your partners’ options beforehand. In negotiation, it is important to think several moves in advance and anticipate your partners’ needs. 
      * *Know the difference between "positions" and "interests."* When you focus on your organization’s motivation for partnering and your potential partners’ motivation, then you are looking at interests. When you get bogged down in achieving a particular goal, then you are distracted by positions. Interests form the building blocks of lasting agreements. 
      * *Come prepared to commit resources.* Any request to take on greater responsibility must be accompanied by an offer of resources. Approach this issue with an earnest commitment to supporting the goals and the needed change. Resources can take the form of funding, staff, materials, supplies, transportation, and facilities, often in combination. An adequate commitment of funds and other resources demonstrates your commitment to, and full support of the partnership.
      * *Take a fresh look at practices and standards.* Use the negotiation process to address areas that need improvement, such as increased outreach activities and staff development activities. Challenge yourself to examine existing practice: Is this truly the practice that needs to be adopted by all, or is there a new way to meet standards? Set short-term, realistic goals, yet keep sight of where the partnership needs to be.
      * *Allow sufficient time for partners to work out details.* Remember that the negotiation process is not a one-time meeting that results in a partnership agreement. Partners often need several meetings to develop an agreement that reflects everyone’s needs and capacities and provides sufficient detail to ensure success and enhanced services.

      Partnership agreements should be put in writing, and reviewed annually. The agreement should contain sufficient detail to guide the partnership and serve as a mechanism by which partners assess the fulfillment of their commitments and contributions. As a legal document, the agreement protects all partners’ best interests.  Many partnership agreements also include an addendum that describes how the partnership conducts business.  This addendum might specify who does what, when, how, with whom, and for what purpose. It may also contain specific outcome goals and a plan to measure achievement.
