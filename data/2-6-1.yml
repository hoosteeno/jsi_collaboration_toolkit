    Robert is the director of a community-based organization in Franklin County that links and coordinates local teenage pregnancy prevention services.  The organization, entitled F-CAPP (Franklin’s Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention), has over 30 member organizations representing mental health, local faith organizations, the primary school system, university professors and students, teenage pregnancy prevention programs and family members.  In spite of its wide range of members and diverse representation of local groups, the county continued to experience a climbing teenage pregnancy rate and ranked the third highest statewide.  Additionally, the program was located in a southern county which had a higher than average unemployment rate and the high school graduation rate was below average, with current projections showing the rates worsening in coming years.

    Robert raised the issue of the county’s increasing teen pregnancy rate at F-CAPP’s monthly Board of Directors meeting.  After much discussion, it was decided that F-CAPP needed to redirect its efforts and develop new outreach efforts so as to better prevent unplanned pregnancies from occurring.

    Robert was tasked with completing a new, up-to-date community assessment.  With his task in hand, Robert began gathering the most accessible data: community demographics, socioeconomic data, employment and graduation rates and teenage pregnancy data.  Using several resources, including www.city-data.com, the Census Bureau’s website, and state vital statistics, current information was gathered about the county’s population. In addition, community members were surveyed to identify leaders and determine what issues were most important to them.  Finally, to get a more in-depth look at teenage pregnancy, unemployment and graduation rates, Robert contacted the local health department’s environmental health division and worked with them to conduct an analysis of the county’s zip codes to determine the neighborhoods most at risk and using the Geographic Information System (GIS) display these neighborhoods on a county map.

    Based on this assessment, Robert found that a disproportionate amount of teenage pregnancies were located in the central and eastern parts of the county.  Not surprisingly, many of the neighborhoods with both high rates of unemployment rates and low rates of high school graduation also had the highest teenage pregnancy rates.  The community survey found that people were most concerned about the lack of employment opportunities and teenage pregnancy.  It also found that they were largely unaware of the teenage pregnancy prevention resources and services that existed.  Through discussions with the local business administration, Robert was informed that there were two reasons why potential new businesses settled elsewhere: the high teenage pregnancy rate and low graduation rates.
