      h4. Readiness for Partnering and Identifying Prospective Partners

      The first step in pursuing a strategic partnership is to know your own organization’s strengths and weaknesses.  This will help you determine the type of partnership that will be the most beneficial.  Once these have been identified, involve your staff in narrowing down a list of organizations within your community that may fill your needs (compliment your strengths and address your weaknesses).  Aids such as the "Organizational Readiness Assessment":downloads/1-4_Organizational_Readiness_Assessment.pdf and the "Barriers and Challenges to Partnerships tool":downloads/1-4_Barriers_and_Challenges_to_Partnerships.pdf in the "Tools and Resources":#chapter-1/section-1-4 section can serve as a helpful guide for assessing your organizational readiness, defining your organization’s goals, and identifying prospective partners.

      Do not ignore the strengths of your organization.  A partnership is a two-way street, and you have valuable resources to offer.  Because you have a deep understanding of an adolescent’s needs, your organization’s greatest asset is the ability to help these adolescents deal with the challenging situation they find themselves in, and you bring these strengths to the partnership.

      Before entering into a partnership, give some consideration to how you will evaluate the effectiveness of such a relationship in the future. Knowing what success will look like before you start will help you know when you achieve it. It is important to assess potential partnerships at the beginning to ensure that you will work well together and that you are striving for the same goal.  The tool "Evaluating Potential Partners":downloads/1-4_Evaluating_Potential_Partners.pdf can guide your organization through this analysis.
