    Selena is the director of the Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices teenage pregnancy prevention and education outreach program in San Diego County, California.  Targeted at young adolescent and teenage Hispanic girls, the goal of Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices is to prevent unwanted teenage pregnancy, delay the onset of sexual activity, and if pregnancy occurs, to provide linkages to services to assist clients in caring for their child.  Finally, vouchers for free or reduced cost medical services, free condoms and birth control are made available to teens who want them.

    Healthy Lives, Healthy Choices has been in existence for eight years, with Selena as its founder and director. With the heavy migration of Hispanic individuals into the area, the demand for services has increased.  With this influx of new clients, Selena noticed that the girls who sought assistance were often three or more years younger than their sexual partners and that a traditional male-dominated culture assisted in fostering unhealthy relationships.  To make matters worse, these unhealthy relationships, which at times included physical, mental and/or emotional abuse, appeared to be reinforced by the girls’ friends, families and the greater community.  Conversations with young girls found that they were often afraid of losing or upsetting their boyfriend, causing them to consent to sex at younger ages or that their desire to have unconditional love and support made them want to have a child.  Concerned by this, Selena decided that she would work to change the dynamics of these unhealthy relationships in her community.
