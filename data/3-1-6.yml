    h4. STEP 7: Evaluate the Effectiveness of Your Message

    As a health or community service organization, evaluation should be part of any initiatives undertaken.  The evaluation methodology can employ focus groups, key informant interviews, "SurveyMonkey":http://www.surveymonkey.com/ and "Facebook polls":http://www.facebook.com/OpinionPolls, surveys, and/or street interviews.  The "Focusing Your Evaluation tool":downloads/3-3-10_Focusing_Your_Evaluation-Work_Matrix_Example.pdf can guide your organization through an evaluation.  If you evaluate your communication plan in terms of both how well you carry it out and how well it works, you will be able to make changes to improve it.  It will keep getting more effective each time you implement it.  No plan is ever perfect, but you can make yours as effective as possible if you monitor and evaluate it continually.

    p(pull-quote). As with just about every phase of health and community work, your organization must continually adjust its communications plan.  Memories are short and your organization must keep reminding the community of its key messages, that your organization performs important and successful work, and that the problems and issues in question have not gone away. ^[i]^
