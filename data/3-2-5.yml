      %(dojofore big blue left)&#58419;% Channels of communication relate to the medium through which you convey your key messages.  There are numerous channels to choose from in order to reach your target audience depending on what the members of your audience read, listen to, watch, and engage in.  It is critical that your organization understand what works effectively with different audiences.  The "Communications Channels worksheet":downloads/3-3-7_Communications_Channels.pdf will help you brainstorm and provide ideas for potential communications channels.

      The individuals that can help you spread your message can vary and include community leaders, elected officials, CEOs of local businesses, clergy, community activists and ordinary people who are nonetheless respected and listened to by their neighbors.  Institutions and organizations, such as colleges, hospitals, service clubs, faith communities, and other health and community organizations all have access to groups of community members who might need to hear your message.

      As mentioned in Chapters I and II, developing ways of contacting and establishing relationships with influential individuals and institutions in the community and/or the population you are trying to reach is an important part of your outreach plan.  You have to make personal contacts, give the media and others reasons to want to help you, and follow through over time to sustain those relationships in order to keep communication channels open.

      The "Checklist for Effective Brochures":downloads/3-3-8_Checklist_for_Effective_Brochures.pdf and "Characteristics of Quality Educational and Promotional Materials":downloads/3-3-9_Characteristics_of_Quality_Educational_and_Promotional_Materials.pdf tools will help your organization ensure that the materials being produced are effective.  Remember that your organization offers a unique benefit to the community that no other organization can claim.  If you keep this in the front of your mind as you develop your message, you will have great success in reaching those who can help you fulfill your mission.
