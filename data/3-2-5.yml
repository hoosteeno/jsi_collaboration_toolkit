    h4. Plan for Communications Emergencies

    Any number of things can happen in the course of a communication effort.  Someone can forget to e-mail a press release, or can e-mail the wrong information.  A crucial word on your posters or in your brochure can be misspelled, or the phone number or e-mail address of your organization might be incorrect.  A reporter may misunderstand important information, or simply get it wrong.  Worse, you might have to deal with a real disaster involving the organization that has the potential to discredit everything you do.

    It is important to try to anticipate these kinds of problems, and to create a plan to deal with them.  Crisis planning should be part of any communication plan, so you will know exactly what to do when a problem or crisis occurs.  Crisis plans should include who takes responsibility for what â€“ dealing with the media, correcting errors, deciding when something has to be redone rather than fixed.  It should cover as many situations, and as many aspects of each situation, as you can think of, so that you will not be too surprised and upset to do the right thing when one of them comes up. ^[i]^

    Some tips for managing controversy include:

    (alternating)* *Before taking action, define the real problem*: Obtain copies of the article, television transcript, information from the state or federal agency or other documents that describe the situation.  Follow-up with telephone calls to the original source to verify the facts and get more detailed information.
    * *Determine the scope of the problem*: Assess whether the problem is a local, regional or national concern. This will entail anticipating the extent of the media coverage and evaluating whether an issue, such as an allegation about a policy, is national or confined to one area.
    * *Determine the potential impact on your organization*: Assess if the problem can be isolated to one department or issue, or if it will affect your entire agency. Assess if the problem has &quot;staying power&quot; or is limited to a &quot;one-time&quot; story.
    * *Mobilize your issues management team*: When a controversy develops, these individuals should be allowed to devote themselves entirely to the situation.  An issues management plan should be in place and ready to go.
    * *Centralize the control of information*: Make sure your messages are consistent and clear.
    * *Appoint only one spokesperson, backed up by experts as appropriate.*
    * *Communicate with internal audiences*: Besides the media, be sure to communicate with your employees, local officials, service recipients and other government agencies throughout the controversy.  By providing information quickly, it will be possible to speak &quot;with one voice&quot; and avoid confusion.
    * *Be flexible*: Try to accommodate journalists, reporters and producers by providing timely and accurate information.  Local media do not treat stories in the same way as national reporters.  Make sure your spokesperson understands the different needs of these media and can anticipate the kinds of information they are seeking. ^[ii]^
