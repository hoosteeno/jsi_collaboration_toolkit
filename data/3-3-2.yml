    h4. Create a Profile for Your Target Audience

    <div class="gloss">
    Recommended data collection, analyses and interpretation: 
    
    Use of this tool should be a group process with your staff.  
    
    Two key questions this tool can help you answer are: 
    a) What are your audiencesâ€™ concerns?; and b) What characteristics of your audience are important to your organization (e.g. their education levels, parenting skills; health issues)? 
    
    Information for each question should be based on the outcome consensus agreement resulting from discussion by you, your staff and your partners (if possible). The answers should focus on providing key information that will guide decisions leading to the formulation of your outreach activities and better targeting your intended audience.

    This tool will enable you to understand your audience so that your message can be tailored to their specific characteristics.
    
    The questions are:

    1. Why is your audience important to you?

    2. Why should your audience care about your organization and its issues?

    3. What do you want from this audience?  What do they want/need from you?

    4. How does this audience receive information?

    5. Are there particular individuals who have credibility or power over the target audience?  If so, identify them.

    6. Are there other individuals that can help you better reach this target audience? Who?

    7. How will you know if you have successfully reached this audience?

    TIPS:  Do not assume that you know the audience, even if you have worked with them for a while.  Put yourself in their shoes and think about what they need and want from your organization. Remember, your audience is a subset of the general population.
