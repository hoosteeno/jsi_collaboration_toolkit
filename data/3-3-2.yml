    !(right)/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/images/case4.jpg!
    The first thing Selena did was meet with her staff and identify the exact campaign message needed.  A conversation was started around what the overall purpose and goal(s) were. Selena engaged the group in an exercise to clearly lay out Healthy Lives, Healthy Choicesâ€™ values and goals and what the organization tries to accomplish.  The following questions were posed to the staff:
    
    * What are the most important accomplishments of our organization? Can you describe in simple, short and clear terms what the organization does?
    * How do funders/stakeholders/clients react to our message?
    * How does our message help shape public perception of controversial issues?
    * What statements and sound bites will be most memorable and persuasive to our key audiences?
    * How does the message fit with our mission/vision and services?

    During discussion, the group realized that the current model for male-dominant relationships was being taught and reinforced by the following groups: faith organizations, media, peers and family.  The staff became aware that some of their potential funders were community leaders with traditional viewpoints, which could affect the overall success of the campaign and that open discussion about sexual relationships was still taboo in their community.  The issue appeared to be ingrained in the community, making Selena realize that several different audiences needed to be targeted.  Because of this, they decided a more positive approach to the issue would be beneficial, where they would focus on the benefits of a healthy relationship, including communication and respect between partners.  Therefore, staff decided that the official purpose of the message would be to promote the benefits of healthy relationships in their community.
