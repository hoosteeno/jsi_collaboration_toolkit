    h4. Identify Your Purpose
    
    What you want to say depends on your mission and what you are trying to accomplish with your communication strategy.  There are some communication goals that may be ongoing – raising your profile in the community, informing people about your program – while others may vary, depending on circumstances.  Most organizations develop several complementary but distinct messages based on target audience and purpose.

    First, establish a framework for what you are trying to communicate – the "who, what, and why."

    (chunky)* *Who is your audience?*
    It is important to assess the audience you are trying to reach.  Your key target audiences go hand in hand with your purpose: who needs to hear what you have to say in order for your organization to achieve its intent?
    * *What are you offering to your audience?*
    Think about the community you serve.  What are its needs and available resources?  If you are trying to reach multiple audiences, realize that each will have different answers to this question.  Learn what motivates them and determine what you want them to take away about your organization.
    * *Why does your message matter to your audience?*
    This is a crucial part of your message: "why" your audience should care about what you have to say.  Think again about the "what" and the benefits your audience may receive. There are different kinds of benefits you may want to highlight:
      ** A feeling: a sense of generosity when they donate their time or money;
      ** A material benefit: better community economy;
      ** An anticipated benefit: getting school credit for community service or volunteer hours.

    Both leadership and staff should work together to develop a clear message. Staff at all levels will bring a unique perspective on your community’s needs and resources.

    You can engage your staff members by having them tackle important questions:
    * What are the most important accomplishments of our organization? Can you describe in simple, short and clear terms what the organization does?
    * How will funders/stakeholders/clients react to our message?
    * How does your message help shape public perception on controversial issues?
    * What statements and sound bites will be most memorable and persuasive to your key audiences?
    * How does the message fit with your mission/vision and services?

    Answering these questions will make it easier for your target audience to recognize your organization’s unique message.  With so much information competing for space, having a clearly branded message will make outreach efforts much easier.  It helps to distinguish your organization from others.  Once everyone in your organization understands what your message is, your organization can choose the appropriate audience and begin crafting the language in your message.
