    Your message will be very different if you are recruiting participants than if you are trying to rally the public, or if you are trying to convince a population at risk to change their habits.  Planning the content of your message is necessary to making it effective.
    
    Elements of a communication plan often include:
    * Identifying 3-5 key messages
    * Identifying a credible spokesperson
    * Identifying target audiences, internal and external

    Key Messages should:
    * Inform
    * Promote
    * Involve

    h4. Design Principles

    * Think about how you will distribute the information – handout or display.
    * What size do you want it to be?  Something that individuals can put in their pockets?  Consider a business card.
    * Paper color and texture play an important role. Gloss paper with bold colors creates an upscale image. Plain copier paper creates a poor image.
    * Are you going to print this or have a professional printer do this?  Check with a printer while you are designing the information/ promotional piece.  They can help with selecting color and paper and let you know if the size you are considering is standard or will require special cuts (more expensive).
    * Cultural and ethnic considerations – know your audience.  Test your materials with the target audience, and work with local organizations that also serve that audience for translation and interpretation services.
