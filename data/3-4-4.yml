    h4. Crafting the Message

    Now that the purpose was identified and the audiences profiled, Selena worked on crafting her messages.  In order to ensure that each message was appropriate, Selena focused on their content. First, Selena used the Crafting Clear Communications Checklist on page 58 for each audience to ensure the message(s) addressed the principles described.  Keeping the Crafting Clear Communications Checklist on hand, she used the Message Development worksheet on page 59 to clarify the issue, why each audience needed to care about the issue, and what she wanted them to do about the issue.  Finally, she used the "Suggested Messaging tool":downloads/3-3-6_Suggested_Messaging.pdf to ensure that the language and content would be appropriate for the targeted group.

    While crafting the messages, Selena made sure that the mood of the messages appealed to the emotions she was attempting to elicit from each audience.  Because the overall goal was to promote healthy relationships and their benefits, she decided to stay away from an angry tone and rather use one of determination and hope.  For the faith community, the link was made between healthy relationships and decreased sexual activity and teenage pregnancy.  For recreational clubs, personal stories and messages from clients and teens were used to address the issue.  Finally, for public institutions, the cost differences/savings of promoting healthy relationships over ignoring negative ones was addressed.

    After the messages were reviewed and edits made, Selena and her group examined the language and chosen style of communication for each.  To determine the most effective promotion language and communication styles for each, Selena did research into what had worked previously and engaged in discussions with members of the target audience to gauge their preferences.  During this research phase, Selena set out to answer the following questions:

    * What is the primary language of the community? If English is not the primary language, how is communication translated?
    * How does the target audience receive its information (Internet, newspapers, radio)?  Where do they access such information (libraries, schools, etc.)?  How often is this information accessed?
    * How does the audience share information with each other?  
    * How does the community discuss adolescent pregnancy issues, if at all?
    * What are cultural norms that need to be considered?  Would a certain phrase be offensive?

    Based on their findings, the decision was made to make the messages available in both English and Spanish, as much of the community was bilingual. Further, Selena found that groups preferred different modes of communication, all of which necessitated unique approaches. Finally, each group had varying cultural norms which led to different wordings of the same message.  For instance, discussion of contraception was removed from messages targeted at religious institutions so members would not be offended.

    Once the messages were developed, Selena set about ensuring that while different, each message was consistent with the overall purpose of promoting healthy relationships in the community.  Both Selena and her staff reviewed the messages to make sure they did not contradict one another.  A master list of each message and its target audience was developed for everyone to refer to in case questions were asked.  All materials were reviewed to ensure the appropriate message was on the appropriate item based on the audience set to receive it.  Finally, an informal focus group was held with a couple of members from each target audience to ensure the message was read and interpreted the way it was intended.
