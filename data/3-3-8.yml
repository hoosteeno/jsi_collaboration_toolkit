    h4. Checklist for Effective Brochures

    It is critical that your organization understand what works effectively with different audiences.  Remember that each audience is unique, and that messages that engage some audiences do not necessarily engage all audiences.

    Use this checklist to determine whether your brochures will be effective in engaging their audience.
    
    CHECKLIST

    * “Selling message” is on the cover (4 out of 5 people will not read beyond the cover page – just the name of your agency may not tell the reader much).

    * Brand: consistent look to all your marketing and informational materials.

    * Photos, graphics, pictures are all captioned – most people will read captions.

    * No clichés, acronyms, initials, jargon.

    * Tells the person what they need to know (long version is okay once you get them to start reading).

    * Most important facts are highlighted for those not going to read much.

    * There is a clear call to action – what do you want the person to do?

    * Testimonials are included – this adds credibility.

    * It is as personable as possible – write in conversational words.
